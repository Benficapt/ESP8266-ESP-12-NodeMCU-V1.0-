# ESP8266-ESP-12-NodeMCU-V1.0
We will be connecting the NodeMCU to PC, Installing Esplorer IDE, Uploading Latest firmware and a test sketch to blink onboard LED and externally connected LED.

*Youtube video showing the working of this code- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7GzK7zHKOk 

*Programming IDE - esplorer available at http://esp8266.ru/esplorer/  or   https://github.com/4refr0nt/ESPlorer  

*Firmware flasher to update firmware- https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/blob/master/Win64/Release/ESP8266Flasher.exe 

*Firmware- https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/releases 
I have used -  nodemcu_float_0.9.6-dev_20150704.bin firmware

*Pin configuration of nodemcu V 1.0: https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0

NOTE- Just plug USB cable between your PC and Nodemcu - no additional hardware modifications or power supply are required.

Unlike other ESP8266 modules,while flashing firmware, loading sketches, running in normal operations, NO NEED of changing any pin configuration (e.g. pulling high or low pin 0 ,2 etc), NodeMCU E12 dev kit does everything internally.
